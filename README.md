## About this workflow

Mainly following the KISS principle my workflow consists of this three main pillars:

- Web browser - With vim keybindings and panorama tabs gives me the clear view of project's research, is fast and also secure.
- IDE - Neovim is my only IDE on this machine, is feature packed and incredibly fast.
- Terminal - With the help of a few keybindings, is simple and versatile.
