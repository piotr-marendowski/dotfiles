# dotfiles

My dotfiles repo for programs only (environment agnostic), which means that it won't contain any qtile/dwm/dwl/xorg/wayland etc. stuff in it.

For environment-specific dotfiles see:

- [linux-dotfiles branch qtile (xorg)](https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/linux-dotfiles/tree/qtile)  
- [linux-dotfiles branch dwm (xorg)](https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/linux-dotfiles/tree/dwm)  
- [linux-dotfiles branch dwm-wayland (wayland)](https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/linux-dotfiles/tree/dwm-wayland)  
- [older qtile config](https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/qtile-config)  
- [old dotfiles-gallery repo with some rices](https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/dotfiles-gallery)  

## Programs

- nvim  
- zsh  

## Cloning/installation

I recommend using it with these listed above.
