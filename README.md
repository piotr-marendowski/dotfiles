# dotfiles

## History
After accidentally breaking my machine, I decided to move to Arch Linux full time. Then it converted into a hassle with configuring it all
over again, so now I created an install script to do everything for me.

## Installation
Installation only requires git to clone this repository and rename it do `.dotfiles`.
```
git clone https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/dotfiles.git
mv dotfiles .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./script.sh
```
